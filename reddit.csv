It did, and I was able to sell a bunch before February came and wiped out the value of the remaining options (*As I've said before, options trading is extremely risky and buying out-of-the-money options even more so). [Total profit, ~$2,500,000](https://ibb.co/gk0bax).

Many of you know I was posting about $100k in SPX calls back in December and then January when the value started taking off. Figured I owed you an update.

Why I bought a crazy amount of SPX calls:
Congress passed a bill slashing corporate tax rates in December. The last time corporate taxes were reduced so much was back in 1986. So I looked at how the market reacted at the beginning of 1987 and saw a huge spike in the S&P 500 in the first quarter.

I wanted to bet the market would react in a similar fashion. I looked through various strike prices in Jan-Mar and modeled which ones would have the highest payouts if Jan 2018 was a repeat of Jan 1987. I also ran a few more conservative scenarios and bought options at those inflection points as well. Many of these options were so far out of the money at the time they were selling for under a dollar. With volatility so low a melt up wasn’t being priced in at all so I put in every dollar I was comfortable losing.

January turned out to be the best first month of the year for the market in more than two decades. The value of the options skyrocketed, some by as much as 5000%. 

I was excited and terrified for the same reasons I bought options and not futures or heavily margined shares in the first place. Going back to 1987, there was eventually a large crash (Black Monday) that wiped out most of the gains for that year. I also knew we were currently going through one of the largest stretches of market history without a substantial pullback. I was pretty sure the market was going to go up and fast, but it was like a game of hot potato to lock in gains before a major correction happened. 

With that in mind I actively sold off chunks of the investment as it went up in January. Since I didn’t know if or when a correction would happen, I wanted to make sure I locked in as much profit as possible.

I was still holding the bag on a bunch of these options when Feb came and wiped them out, taking a large amount of paper gains with them. Another green week and I definitely would have been into yacht-money territory with this trade.

Still, I’d managed to sell enough in January to lock in two and a half million dollars from a $100k investment.

Aside from NVDA leaps I picked up last year and stocks I plan on holding indefinitely, I'm currently mostly in cash waiting to figure out the next move.",2018-02-26 19:24:41

77,[Educational] Greeks 101,5320,880jhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/880jhv/educational_greeks_101/,289,1522352093.0,"Alright, listen up faggots. It’s come to my attention recently that some of you don’t know jack shit about options. If I wasn’t already terminally autistic, some of the comments I’ve read in the sub might have made me go full retard.

With that said, my friend Jack Daniels and I have taken it upon ourselves to get you motherfuckers #LEARNT on some god damn options. While I have little faith that most of you will truly understand the intimate innerworkings and dynamics of derivatives, I have no doubt that a large majority of you will take one or two small pieces of information away from this. The goal here is to get you to the point where you can start overestimating your abilities again, like a good boy should, instead of blind dick swinging, like most of you are currently doing.

*Disclaimer: I’m going to skip all the boring, possibly foundationally necessary academics behind where the Greeks come from (inb4 Greece), Black, Scholes, and Merton’s research, Ito’s Lemma, and all that jazz. If you want to look it up on your own time, read a fucking book. Hull’s book on derivatives is basically like the bible for this shit.*

*Credibility: I’m a financial analyst in the risk department of a large insurance company, and work with our hedging portfolio on a daily basis. I also have a Bloomberg terminal that I like to aggressively use so that everyone thinks I know what I’m doing.*

#Background
There are only 4 Greeks that you really need to know to trade equity options:

1.	Delta
2.	Gamma
3.	Theta
4.	Vega

If you have at least a modest understanding of these, you’ll be on your way to sweet, sweet tendies in no time. Now onto the gREEEE^EEEEEE^EEks


---


##Delta

Delta is the grand-daddy of them all. The Hugh Heffner of the Greeks. Most of you probably are familiar with delta, because it’s the easiest one. Easier than your sister, which is really saying something.
**Delta represents the relative increase in the price of an option, given an increase in the price of the underlying.** When you buy or sell an option, the price change doesn’t exactly mirror the stock 1:1. Options expire at some point in the future. Stocks don’t expire.

The implication here is that an option is only valuable if you can exercise it for a profit. Logically, this means that deep ITM options will have a delta pretty close to +/-1 (depending on whether it’s a call or a put), while deep OTM options will have a delta pretty close to 0 (or 100/0, whatever convention you use, the only difference is where the decimal is). **Note:** Option deltas range from -1 to 1 (or -100 to 100 deltas). Calls have positive delta (0 to 1) while Puts have negative delta (-1 to 0).

If you’re seeing deltas on your trading platform that are not in this range, you’re probably seeing Dollar Delta, which is just:

Delta x Notional Shares (usually 100 per lot) x Price of Underlying

**Autist’s interpretation:** The easiest way to wrap your autistic brains around this is to think of delta as *roughly* the probability of the underlying stock price going beyond your strike at expiration. For example, an ATM call has around 50 deltas. That means you can intuitively view it as having a 50/50 chance of expiring in the money. An increase in the stock price would give you even greater chances, hence the delta of a slightly ITM call is a little over 50, and deep ITM calls are close to 100 deltas. An ATM Put has roughly -50 deltas. This doesn’t mean a -50% chance of expiring ITM you fucking idiot, it just means that your option value is negatively correlated to price increases.


---



##Gamma

Gamma is the least-hyped Greek out of all of them, but definitely one that could cause your portfolio to turn into a shitshow while you’re not paying attention. **Gamma represents the change in Delta, given a change in the underlying price.**

Gamma is the 2nd order mathematical derivative of price. It tells you how fast your delta will change when price moves happen. Just like speed and acceleration. The second one tells you the rate of change of the first. It can also be interpreted as a measure of convexity, telling you how flat or round something is. Like your flat-chested girlfriend has almost no titty gamma, while Kate Upton titties got gamma for days. Gamma is always positive, and is always largest ATM.

**Autist’s interpretation:** Think of gamma as the big swing when options go from being OTM to ITM or vice versa. So the next time you see that piece of shit stock hitting all time highs, think to yourself “Holy shit, this dumpster fire might actually moon, better YOLO on some calls real quick”, then it drops by $0.05 and your calls drop 50%, blame it on the gamma.


---



##Theta

Theta is the turtle of the greeks. Doesn’t move too fast, doesn’t do too much when you poke it with a stick, boring as fuck. But this is where the time value of options comes from, so it’s important that you know what it is. **Theta is the change in option price, given a 1 day change in time**.

Short option positions have positive theta. Long options positions have negative theta. This means that the marketable value of the  option decays each day it comes closer to the expiration date. Less time to expiry = less time to moon, which means people will pay less for it. This is essentially how options selling strategies make their profits. They bet that the price won’t move that much, and most of the time, they’re actually right, because dumb cucks like you are willing to pay those prices.

Like gamma, theta is also the largest when an option is ATM. As time passes, theta becomes larger and larger. The implication here being that the last week of an option’s life, theta will be exponentially larger.

**Autist’s interpretation:** Think of theta as the shot clock. It keeps ticking away, no matter if the game is exciting or boring. If it’s a really close game (i.e. the option is ATM), then the shot clock is pretty much the make or break thing for you. If the game is a blowout (option is OTM) then it doesn’t really matter that much. When it comes down to the final minute, and it’s make-it-or-break-it for your shitty, shitty, poorly thought out March Madness bracket selections, you’re literally ripping your hair out because you’re on the emotions express, screaming “WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT, REF? ARE YOU FUCKING BLIND?” and then cry and piss yourself in the corner. That’s the only time theta really matters.


---


##Vega

Possibly one of the most misunderstood Greeks, and 105% of the reason behind why RH faggots try to get their trades reversed. **Vega is the change in price of an option for a 1pt increase in the implied volatility of the underlying**.

Now, some of you faggots may know what implied volatility (IV) is, others think you do. No one actually does, because it’s a fucking made up concept in order to get the math to work. The short bus explanation is that implied volatility tells you how much people buying and selling options think that the underlying price has the potential to move in either direction before expiration.

I’m not going to go into how it’s backed out of the Black-Scholes pricing model, or how implied volatility actually represents an estimated annualized 1 standard deviation (68.27%) interval assuming a gaussian distribution of continuous time price movements (specifically addressed to all of you elitist NERDS out there, cash me in the comments, howbow dah?).

Implied volatility is the only unobservable and incalculable input to an option’s price. It’s literally made up. Historically, it hangs out somewhere between 5-10% above historical realized volatility, but when or why it jumps or drops is purely based on the dumb cucks who are trading the options.

The important distinction here is that **Implied Volatility tells you whether an option is relatively expensive or relatively cheap. Vega does not.** Vega just tells you how sensitive an option’s price is to changes in the will of the people.

Both calls and puts have positive vega. Intuitively, this means that when people think the market will move sharply in either direction, options increase in value, because people want protection (or phat gainz).

**Autist’s interpretation:** Vega tells you how much you’re fucked when people lose interest in a hot meme stock after it doesn’t moon, or when people unwad their fucking panties after some good ‘ol Thursday action.

#In Conclusion

Hopefully you retards made it this far without wandering off to try and hump a doorknob. If so, congratulations, I hereby award you 10 good boy points. If there’s enough interest, and I can find more whiskey, I might do a part 2 on basic options strategies and how to completely misapply them.

# About me

- I can only handle one ticker at a time.
- I calculate WSB's sentiment as follows: 

 - Find all the threads containing the ticker in the last week (will probably change this to 24 hours) and get all the comments.
 - Search for predefined words (e.g. for bullish, search for words such as buy, moon, yacht, call, hold etc)
 - Rank them and determine bullish/bearish percentage.
- [F]irst time posting here. Please be gentle.
